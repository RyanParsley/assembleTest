# I'm kicking the tires of Assemble

You don't want to use this code. I'm trying to figure out how to
integrate some familiar code with assemble. I'll take this disclaimer
out if this ever becomes something worth useing.

## Build with:

* [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble)
* [bits from Pickle](https://github.com/RyanParsley/Pickle)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [livereload](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions)
